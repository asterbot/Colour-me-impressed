# Colour-me-impressed
This is a chrome extension to make data more accessible to color-blind people

The extension works by opening a popup window in which a user will enter values from 0 to 360. The program then goes through each image and shifts it's colours by the desired value, allowing people with colorblindness to see these images more easily.

# Future plans
As of now, the extension only shifts the colours of images. In the future, we plan to add a feature to also edit background/text colours for easy viewing.
